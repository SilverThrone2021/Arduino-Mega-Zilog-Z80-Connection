# Arduino-Mega-Zilog-Z80-Connection

This project aims to establish a connection with a Zilog Z80 using an Arduino Mega 2560.
*////Instructions\\\\*

1). Download and unzip the folder.
2). Open the Arduino Mega sketch in Arduino IDE 
3). Download a Zilog emulator (which can program Assembly) from the Zilog official website
4). Connect the Z80 CPU to the Arduino following the wiring image
5). Upload the code to the Mega
6). Test i/o of Z80 through the use of 8-bit switches or led's.
